# Home Page Upgrade (Forest Green)
Files:
- index.html (drop-in replacement for your current home page)
- style-additions.css (append to the bottom of your existing style.css)

Steps:
1) Upload index.html to your repo (overwrite existing).
2) Open style.css in GitHub, click Edit, and paste the contents of style-additions.css at the end. Save.
3) Ensure AOS links remain present for animations to work.

Tip: Add a real image in the Featured block by replacing the placeholder div with an <img> in index.html.
