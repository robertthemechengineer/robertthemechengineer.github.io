# Site Fix + Matching Pages
This bundle fixes the home link-block styling and includes matching page templates.

Files:
- style.css — consolidated + corrected styling (link blocks now match cards)
- index.html — cleaned home, single featured project, consistent link blocks
- projects.html, cad.html, personal.html, resume.html — consistent visuals

Install:
1) Upload/replace style.css and index.html at your repo root.
2) Replace the other pages if you like (or diff them against your current ones).
3) Add images for: images/featured_placeholder.jpg, images/lb_cad.jpg, lb_personal.jpg, lb_resume.jpg.
4) Hard refresh.

If you already have navbar.js and images/logo.svg in place, you don't need to change them.
